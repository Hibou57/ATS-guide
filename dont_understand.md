# Pressing Questions

- How do you prove that a function is a total ordering and show a list is in 
order under the function?
- Is it possible to list the axioms that a program uses?
- Is it possible to make custom statics functions / operators?
- In ATS2 when is MUL necessary?
- Would reimplementing DIVMOD be useful?

# Other/less important questions

## Things I don't understand about proving things

- What size are static integers in bits?
- What does =/=> do? How do you use it?
- Why is =>> not the default? (or backtrack and do it)
- What does the -<prf> side effect do?
- What are the 's2rt_cls', 's2rt_eff' and 's2rt_tkind' sorts?

## Things I don't understand about ATS in general

- What is the difference between 'dats' and 'sats'?
- What is the difference between 'dynload', 'staload' and '#include'? How does it 
relate to linking? What does dynloading a sats file do?
- What do these keywords do: 'stacst', 'stadef', 'rec', 'llam', 'lam@', 
'import', 'prcase', 'classdec', 'symelim', 'symintr', 'tkindef', 'prvar', 
'while*', 'for*', 'with*'
- Why are 'type' and 't@ype' different sorts?
